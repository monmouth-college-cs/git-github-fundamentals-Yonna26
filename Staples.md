1. What excites me about computing is coding and know how to code means I can make video games. I am not sure what kind of projects I want to work on.
2. I programed with python and a tiny bit of C.
3. I don't know
4. I have not used git or github before
5. I think I can bring teamwork to the group project.
6. asking for help in my group, because sometimes I get confused and I feel like everyone knows what to do except me and I might feel like the dumb person in the group for not knowing stuff, so then I don't ask.
